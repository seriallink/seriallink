### :hearts: My likes

- :beers: A beer enthusiast who loves trying new craft brews, especially Imperial Stout and Barleywine. Check out my [Untappd](https://untappd.com/user/seriallink) profile for my latest finds! 
- :jp: Huge anime fan here! *Evangelion* is my all-time favorite, but I'm always open to recommendations. See my [MyAnimeList](https://myanimelist.net/profile/seriallink) profile to follow what I'm watching now.
